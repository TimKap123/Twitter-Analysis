Using Java, I created an android application that contains two parts. One part will count the most used words for any twitter user showing what is important to them. The other part is an algorithm that loops all the words from a twitter handle through a text file I created that contains sustainability related words, and if the words that are sustainability related exceed 50% it prints that the user is sustainable, and if it is less than 50% then the user isn't sustainable. The gamified program aims to drive change to improve human health and defend our planet.
